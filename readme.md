This repository contains sample code for using the datum sensors in FRC.  There are three samples, one each for the [datum-Light][1] color sensor, [datum-Distance][2] time-of-flight laser ranging sensor, and [datum-IMU][3] 9 axis inertial monitoring unit.  The datum sensors are available now through the GroupGets store.  Find out more about them there or on our website at [jandjstudios.io](https://jandjstudios.io).
